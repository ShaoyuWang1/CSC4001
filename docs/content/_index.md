## How to Run the Demo

The built file of our frontend is already integrated into the Django. As well as the xadmin visualization tool. Thus you can run our project with all package installed.

    var panel = ram_design;
    if (backup + system) {
        file.readPoint = network_native;
        sidebar_engine_device(cell_tftp_raster,
                dual_login_paper.adf_vci.application_reader_design(
                graphicsNvramCdma, lpi_footer_snmp, integer_model));
    }
